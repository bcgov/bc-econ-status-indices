# Levels of geography

Levels of geography included in the tax data are:  

-  3 FSA: ([URBAN FSA](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/ref/dict/geo036-eng.cfm))   
-  6 RURPC: (RURAL POSTAL CODE AREAS)

Based on initial consultations and research using Statistics Canada as source, the levels of geography that are usable for this project include those that are small enough to hold the smallest number of taxfilers in a region and is inclusive of all of BC. The challenge here is that not one geography level can be chosen such that it covers all of BC. We determined that economic indices need to be generated for rural and urban communities separately. In the case that a postal code does not fall in the urban (census tracts) or rural (rural communities and postal code) geographies, then we take the next high level of geography (i.e. census division). More specifically, geo level #9 is for RURAL COMMUNITIES, geo level #6 is for RURAL POSTAL CODE AREAS, and geo level #21 is for CENSUS DIVISION.

# Workflow for economic index generation

The simplest strategy for quintile ratio generation is determined by dividing the median total income (from table 1 of individuals) into 5 quintile ranges on a per year and region basis. The quintile ratio varies every year and depending on the regions of geography and the median total income of taxfilers in that region. 

In order to generate the indices, we synthesized a fake data that resembles administrative datasets. Every studyid is associated with a random postal code and level of geography with primary keys. The synthesized data is then linked to tax data in order to associate every region to a quintile range per year. The codes for synthesizing data and making economic indices are in `R` subfolder, named `synthesize_data.R` and `indicies.R` respectively. The urban and rural indices designated for the synthesized data are named as urban quintiles (UQ) and rural quintiles (RQ) and are placed in the `output-data` folder.

# Appendix I: 
Income inequality in Canada is defined in more detail, [here](https://www.compareyourincome.org/income_inequality_in_canada#what_is_the_issue). 
Based on this, the average income in Canada stands at 44000 Canadian dollars. The total income explorer released by Statistics Canada provides additional measures, [here](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dv-vd/inc-rev/index-eng.cfm), and [here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180322/dq180322b-eng.htm).
